This repository contains code intended to work with PNI-RM3100/MCP9808 magnetometers/temp sensors running on a conventional Linux PC.  It is meant to eliminate the need for the Raspberry Pi in a Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) ground magnetometer setup.  

It makes use of a Pololu Isolated USB-to-IÂ²C Adapter with Isolated Power (Pololu item #: 5397) and is meant to support existing magnetometer board designs sold by TAPR (tapr.org), and hopefully future revisions as well.
